### The journey begins

Iâ€™ve been circling around the idea of starting my own technical blog, and Iâ€™ve finally committed to it. As you might have guessed, this is my very first post. I may stumble a bit with how I structure things at the start, but I know Iâ€™ll improve over time.

Through this blog, Iâ€™ll mostly be documenting the technical challenges I face, the solutions I come up with, and the thought process behind them.

Iâ€™m excited to see how this journey unfolds ðŸ˜‡
