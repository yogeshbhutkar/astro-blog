## Hello, World

Iâ€™ve been meaning to start writing for a while, and I finally decided to take the plunge. This blog is built with Astro ðŸš€, and as I continue working on it, Iâ€™ll be documenting the entire process â€” from improving the site itself to sharing the lessons I learn along the way.

Think of this space as my personal log: a mix of experiments, tweaks, and discoveries. Over time, I hope it not only becomes a better blog technically, but also a resource for anyone curious about building with Astro (or just starting their own blogging journey).
